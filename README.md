WikiSentinel
------------

WikiSentinel is a KDE plasmoid written in QML and Javascript.

Its purpose is to help the translators of the KDE Wikis UserBase and TechBase. It monitors (throught [Fuzzybot](http://userbase.kde.org/Special:Contributions/FuzzyBot) Atom feed) the wikis to get the translated pages that need to be updated. 

The users can follow their language without the need to check the Recent changes page or the Language statistics page or to handle the email notifications.

WikiSentinel gathers the changes in a list, the translators can view the details that need to be updated and choose to open the page in the default web browser. It offers a simple archive system to collect the pages no more reported by Fuzzybot.
