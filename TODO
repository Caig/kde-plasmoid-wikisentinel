==== Todo ====

== Bugs ==
* language automatic setting: 3-character language codes not supported (ksh-Ripoarisch, rue-русиньскый)
* esc key doesn't close the preview dialog window (focus issue)
* the first time the plasmoid is used (database creation) the items order is wrong and there is an issue with normal/bold text for read/unread items

== Improvements ==
* continue to clean the code according to guidelines
* add useful bits to icon tooltip on panel
* better config ui (is it possible to have more than one section?)
* better language code configuration (list of languages?)
