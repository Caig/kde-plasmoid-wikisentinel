== Improvements ==
** continue to clean the code according to guidelines

* show the date & time according to user settings
* handle offline/loading state in preview
* better language code configuration (list of languages?)
* config option to enable/disable notifications
* update at request (is useful?)
* more flexible archive (keep not read items? ecc?)
* about the remove animation in item list: use PlasmaExtras.DisappearAnimation when it will work (is this the current issue? https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/106818/)
* download the po file and open it to start translating as alternative action?
* preview dialog window resizeable?
