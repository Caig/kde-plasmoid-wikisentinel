==== Todo ====

== Bug ==
** some items don't load a preview (time issue(?))
** checkered board issue in webview (I think it's solved with newer versions of QtQuick I can't use)
** change of just language code doesn't update the plasmoid
** scrollarea issue when removing items (scrollbar doesn't update/behave bad)
* handle offline state in webview
* better language code configuration (list of languages?)
* the tooltip (for the icon in the panel) doesn't work
* esc key doesn't close the web preview dialog window
* fix config ui (is it possible to have more than one section?) and make translatable that strings (how?)
* fix text vertical alignement (title and time in list items)
* 3-character language codes not supported
* better position for delete icon in list?
* (fix daylight saving time issue - now works?)
* user time of item vs server time of preview
* ...

== Improvements ==
*** use the MediaWiki API
** continue to clean the code according to guidelines
** split more code sections in new files to simplify main.qml
* if there are more than one new item, show just one notification
* show the date & time according to user settings
* config option to enable/disable notifications
* update at request (is useful?)
* more flexible archive (keep not read items? ecc?)
* about the remove animation in item list: use PlasmaExtras.DisappearAnimation when it will work (is this the current issue? https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/106818/)
* download the po file and open it to start translating as alternative action?
* make web preview dialog window more easily drag-able? (but redraw issue)
